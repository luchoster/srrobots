The EdCreate system can be used with Edison robots to complete five EdBuild projects:

* the EdTank,
* the EdDigger,
* the EdRoboClaw,
* the EdCrane, and
* the EdPrinter.

The EdBuild projects require progressive levels of coding capabilities, making them a perfect addition to the Edison programming and robotics curriculum.
